# tex-templates

A suite of tex templates and helper files for both documents and slides. Majority of the examples were taken from [Prof Stephen Boyd](http://stanford.edu/~boyd/) of
Stanford. He compiled this very useful [style guide](https://stanford.edu/class/ee364b/latex_templates/template_notes.pdf). I will 
be adding my own things to it and adjust it according to my needs.
